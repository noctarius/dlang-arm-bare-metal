This toolchain builder script will automatically download, configure, build and install a full bare metal toolchain for C, C++ and D
(at the moment only Cortex-A8 but it is just not yet configurable). This toolchain consists of the typical tools like GCC, AS, LD and
other GNU tools. In addition it will generate GDB, GDC and QEMU for the ARM target platform.

== Usage

The toolchain builder can be downloaded and executed in a single line of code.

```
mkdir toolchain && cd toolchain && bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noctarius/dlang-arm-bare-metal/master/toolchain-build.sh)
```

== Supported OS

At the moment Ubuntu and OS X is supported but more operating systems are going to be supported in the near future.

  * Linux
  ** Ubunutu 15.10 [tested]
  * OS X
  ** 10.11 [tested]
